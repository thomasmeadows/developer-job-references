[aws - types of cloud computing](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/)

### IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

IaaS, PaaS and SaaS are cloud computing service models.

##### IaaS

Infrastructure as a Service, as the name suggests, provides you the computing infrastructure, physical or (quite often) virtual machines and other resources like virtual-machine disk image library, block and file-based storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks etc.

Examples: Amazon EC2, Windows Azure, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine., AWS s3, compose

##### PaaS

Platform as a Service, as the name suggests, provides you computing platforms which typically includes operating system, programming language execution environment, database, web server etc.

Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos.

##### SaaS

Software as a Service model you are provided with access to application software often referred to as "on-demand software". You don't have to worry about the installation, setup and running of the application. Service provider will do that for you. You just have to pay and use it through some client.

Examples: Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365.

Few additional points regarding your question:

AWS (Amazon web services) is a complete suite which involves a whole bunch of useful web services. Most popular are EC2 and S3 and they belong to IaaS service model.
Although Hadoop is based on previous works by Google(GFS and MapReduce), it is not from Google. It is an Apache project. You can find more here. It is just a distributed computing platform and does not fall into any of these service models, IMHO.
Microsoft's Windows Azure is again an example of IaaS.
