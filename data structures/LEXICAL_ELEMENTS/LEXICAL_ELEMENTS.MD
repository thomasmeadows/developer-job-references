#### syntax

The rules for writing the language. Putting together the words and punctuation of a program in a correct way. Could also be called the grammar of the language.

#### semantics

The branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning. To learn the semantics of a programming language is to learn how to articulate an algorithm using the language. Semantics of computer programming are generally harder to learn than syntax, but more easily transfered to other languages.

#### compiler

Checks the syntax and translates the source code into object code.

#### tokens

The characters in a program which are grouped by the compiler. The compiler basically collects the characters of the program into tokens or syntactic units. Some examples of tokens:

* keywords
* identifiers
* constants
* string constants
* operators
* punctuators

#### lexical dissection

The process of collecting the characters of a program into syntactic units or tokens.
