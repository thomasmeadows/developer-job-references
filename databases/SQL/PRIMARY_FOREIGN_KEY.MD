### Primary key

The primary key consists of one or more columns whose data contained within is used to uniquely identify each row in the table.  You can think of the primary key as an address.  If the rows in a table were mailboxes, then the primary key would be the listing of street addresses.

### Foreign key
A foreign key is a set of one or more columns in a table that refers to the primary key in another table.  There isn’t any special code, configurations, or table definitions you need to place to officially “designate” a foreign key.
